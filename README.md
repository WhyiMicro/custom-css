Custom css for [Discord](https://discord.com/). You can use it with [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev/), [Better Discord](https://betterdiscord.app/) and pretty much any Discord modification that allows custom css integration.
You can find raw page [here](https://tf2imicro.github.io/custom-css/custom.css).
## Features
To lazy to put everything up now, but their names explain a lot, so just check out the [tweaks](https://github.com/tf2iMicro/custom-css/tree/main/tweaks) folder.

## Installation
On Discord, go to **Settings > Custom CSS** and add the following code:

    @import url("https://tf2imicro.github.io/custom-css/custom.css");
> **Warning**.
At times, Discord will update some of their code, breaking some of the css. I'll try my best to keep the css relative.
